# Real-Time-Temporal-Analysis-of-Global-Population-Impact-Factors
This project presents a real-time visualization system that analyzes and monitors year-wise trends in global population impacts caused by various socio-economic and environmental stressors, including diseases, viruses, natural disasters, conflict zones, and economic downturns. By dynamically processing CSV data and generating live plots, the system enables stakeholders to observe patterns, fluctuations, and emerging threats to population well-being over time. It supports rapid insights for research, policy-making, and humanitarian response planning, offering a clear and interactive representation of how different factors have affected populations across years.
